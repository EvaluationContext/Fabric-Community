# Week 1: Top Trumps Edition - Is Affordability Enough for Briarport?

## Description

For this challenge, I wanted create something visually captivating and interesting to community stakeholders. Inspired by the classic "Top Trumps" card game, I designed a **"Head-to-Head" comparison tool** that gives each city a distinct personality and allows for direct benchmarking against peers.

## The Data Story: Briarport's Dilemma

Using the 2024 dataset, my analysis identifies Briarport as "*The Wallet Winner*" dominating the field with the best Housing Affordability Index (24.6). However, the data reveals a critical trade-off: the city is "Green Poor," ranking in the bottom tier for Green Space (<35%).

## Key Features

- **City Comparison Cards:** An interactive executive view that assigns data-driven Monikers (e.g., "The Heavy Breather", "The Utopia") to instantly communicate a city's character. With trophies to indicate the winning city and which metric trumped the other.
- **Analytical Deep Dive:** Bump charts, line charts and tables that allow Policy Analysts to pick out trends, strengths and weaknesses.
- **Strategic Recommendation:** The report concludes that Briarport should pivot to a "Green Infrastructure" strategy—using its affordability advantage to fund the parks needed to reach top-tier Livability status

## Design & Accessibility

The report utilizes a clean aesthetic with high-contrast visuals, clear tab orders for navigation, and alt-text to ensure the "Head-to-Head" experience is accessible to all users.
